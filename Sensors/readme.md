## Guidelines for Adding a New Sensor

1. **Create a Subfolder:**
   - Name the folder after the sensor (e.g., `PT100`, `DHT22`, `BMP180`).

2. **Add a README.md:**
   - Provide an overview of the sensor.
   - Include wiring instructions.
   - Describe the code examples and how to use them.
   - Link to datasheets or other relevant documentation.

3. **Include Source Code:**
   - Add example code files demonstrating how to interface with the sensor.

4. **Add Schematics:**
   - Include wiring diagrams or schematics if applicable.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Add any additional documentation, datasheets, or useful resources.
